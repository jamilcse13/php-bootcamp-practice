- **ls**: The ls command lists files and directories within a system. Running it without a flag or parameter will show the current working directory’s content.
<br>
To see other directories’ content, type ls followed by the desired path. For example, to view files in the Documents folder, enter:
<br>
**ls /home/username/Documents**
* * *

- **pwd**: Use the **pwd** command to find the path of your current working directory. Simply entering **pwd** will return the full current path – a path of all the directories that starts with a forward slash (/). For example, **/home/username**
* * *

- **cat**: Concatenate, or **cat**, is one of the most frequently used Linux commands. It lists, combines, and writes file content to the standard output. To run the cat command, type **cat** followed by the file name and its extension. For instance:
**cat filename.txt.**
<hr>

- **touch**: The **touch** command allows you to create an empty file or generate and modify a timestamp in the Linux command line.
<br>
For example, enter the following command to create an HTML file named Web in the Documents directory:
**touch /home/username/Documents/Web.html** 
* * *

- **find**: Use the find command to search for files within a specific directory and perform subsequent operations. Here’s the general syntax:
<br>
find [option] [path] [expression]
<br>
For example, you want to look for a file called notes.txt within the home directory and its subfolders:
<br>
**find /home -name notes.txt**
* * *

- **grep**-: Another basic Linux command on the list is **grep** or global regular expression print. It lets you find a word by searching through all the texts in a specific file.
<br>
Once the grep command finds a match, it prints all lines that contain the specific pattern. This command helps filter through large log files.
<br>
For example, you want to search for the word blue in the notepad.txt file:
**grep blue notepad.txt**
<br>
The command’s output will display lines that contain blue.
